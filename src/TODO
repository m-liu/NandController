- Separate CE#
- Separate NAND_CLK and RE#! (need to assert the correct one based on the ce#)
- Use typedefs for command vector sizes (or arrays)
- delay adjustment for DQ line
- Sync Delay adjustment to clk0 domain (there are timing errors otherwise)
- Implement and simulate in ISE
- DQ reversing because of pin swap of front/back packages

- Remove DQS simulation delay in post implementation sim
- Timing and FIFO size adjustments
- DQS pull up down resistors or Gating
- Short reset used in the  model right now
- Full support for async read/writes
