- WE#-1(NAND_CLKS) and WE#-2 are connected to the same wire (bad choice!). OK in sync mode, but in async mode, must be careful that we only assert a single CE# for two buses
- Timing and FIFO size adjustments
- ECC integration and blocking
- Scoreboard and multibus



/*** Testing ***/
- All buses
- Cycle counter
- [OK] High toggle rate data
- [OK] Write/readback to just first page of each block. 
- [OK] vio

/*** May not be needed ***/
- Read calibration for each chip. For now calibrate a single chip and use that calib value for the entire bus [ok here?]
- DQ-DQS skew calibration [ok here?]
- Remove DQS simulation delay in post implementation sim
- IDELAY tap currently fixed in parameter. Need to make adjustable [don't need?]
- delay adjustment for DQ line [don't need?]


/*** DONE ***/
- Short reset used in the  model right now
- Full support for async read/writes. Do this as a test case first
- Use typedefs for command vector sizes (or arrays)
- Separate CE#
- DQS pull up down resistors or Gating
- Use fix delay adjustments instead. Sync Delay adjustment to clk0 domain (there are timing errors otherwise). 
- ISERDES frame alignment and valid data cycle capture (solved using read timing calibration procedure)
- initial values of CEN, WPN etc. is incorrect for a bit after power up need to set INIT parameter in FDRE reg
- ECC detection bug. cant_correct flag is not being asserted
- ECC Encoder
- Test out chipscope signals
- Separate NAND_CLK and WE#! (tied all together)
- DQ reversing because of pin swap of front/back packages
- Remap CE#'s *PINS* to half buses
- UCF verification: double check wen_nclk pins
- Output drive strength, slew rate (FPGA and NAND)? <- doesn't seem to be a problem
