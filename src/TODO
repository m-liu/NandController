- Timing and FIFO size adjustments; ECC fifos sizes and timing too conservative
- ECC can't correct flag handling
- May need additional ECC decoders to max bandwidth
- Possible issue: decodeInQ is full if there are too many errors. This could occur after many sequential reads as the buffer slowly fills due to slow ECC.
- Handle status returning E1 on block erases (failed)

- SB optimization: prioritize read command issuing
- Adjust status polling freq
- Sim test erases, r/w/e mixed 



/*** May not be needed ***/
- Read calibration for each chip. For now calibrate a single chip and use that calib value for the entire bus [ok here?]
- DQ-DQS skew calibration [ok here?]
- Remove DQS simulation delay in post implementation sim
- IDELAY tap currently fixed in parameter. Need to make adjustable [don't need?]
- delay adjustment for DQ line [don't need?]


/*** DONE ***/
- FIX LATENCY COUNTER (keep two 64bit counters, one for lat one for bytes read)
- Compile for 8 buses - does regfile have enough ports? No. We can either replicate for each bus or try to use arrays directly. Replicated.
- create separate block for chipscope ICON and ILA 
- try reads on simultaneous buses jeez!!
- Scoreboard: 
	- [ok] ECC decoder in buffer resizing; 
	- [ok] change POLL_STATUS to GET_STATUS and return status to sb
	- [ok] request for write data from flashcotnroller before a write
	- [meh] need to wait for FIFO empty before starting a read. Either wait for it or do something else and come back to it

- [at 128] Increase number of tags
- Scoreboard and multibus
- [good] try RegFile for tag table
- [ok?] increase cmdoutQ in sb
- [ok?] increase per chip command fifo depth
- [ok] create a fixed test input, use vin as "go" signal. Erase, write, then readback
- fix CE not deselected after issuing read cmd
- modify tb for testing parallel accesses
- ECC integration and blocking
- WE#-1(NAND_CLKS) and WE#-2 are connected to the same wire (bad choice!). OK in sync mode, but in async mode, must be careful that we only assert a single CE# for two buses
- Short reset used in the  model right now
- Full support for async read/writes. Do this as a test case first
- Use typedefs for command vector sizes (or arrays)
- Separate CE#
- DQS pull up down resistors or Gating
- Use fix delay adjustments instead. Sync Delay adjustment to clk0 domain (there are timing errors otherwise). 
- ISERDES frame alignment and valid data cycle capture (solved using read timing calibration procedure)
- initial values of CEN, WPN etc. is incorrect for a bit after power up need to set INIT parameter in FDRE reg
- ECC detection bug. cant_correct flag is not being asserted
- ECC Encoder
- Test out chipscope signals
- Separate NAND_CLK and WE#! (tied all together)
- DQ reversing because of pin swap of front/back packages
- Remap CE#'s *PINS* to half buses
- UCF verification: double check wen_nclk pins
- Output drive strength, slew rate (FPGA and NAND)? <- doesn't seem to be a problem

/*** Testing ***/
- [OK] All buses
- [OK] High toggle rate data
- [OK] Write/readback to just first page of each block. 
- [OK] vio
