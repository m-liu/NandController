- ISERDES frame alignment and valid data cycle capture
- Separate NAND_CLK and RE#! (need to assert the correct one based on the ce#)
- DQ reversing because of pin swap of front/back packages
- initial values of CEN, WPN etc. is incorrect for a bit after power up need to set INIT parameter in FDRE reg
- Full support for async read/writes

- Remove DQS simulation delay in post implementation sim
- delay adjustment for DQ line
- Timing and FIFO size adjustments
- Short reset used in the  model right now


/*** DONE ***/
- Use typedefs for command vector sizes (or arrays)
- Separate CE#
- DQS pull up down resistors or Gating
- Use fix delay adjustments instead. Sync Delay adjustment to clk0 domain (there are timing errors otherwise).
